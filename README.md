-ICMR's i-DRONE Initiative: Transforming Healthcare Delivery in Remote Areas of India

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has initiated several innovative projects to leverage technology for healthcare, and one of these initiatives could indeed involve drones. The use of drones in healthcare has gained traction globally, particularly for delivering medical supplies to remote areas, transporting samples for testing, and even in emergency medical response. In the context of India, where reaching remote or rural areas can be challenging, drones could play a significant role in improving healthcare accessibility. For instance, they could be used to transport medical supplies, vaccines, or even blood samples for testing, especially in areas where traditional transportation methods are limited or inefficient. These initiatives often involve collaboration between government agencies, research institutions, and private companies to ensure successful implementation. The ICMR's involvement in such initiatives demonstrates a commitment to exploring innovative solutions to improve healthcare delivery across the country. In pursuit of the same, ICMR launched an initiative in 2021 named ‘i-DRONE’ (ICMR’s Drone Response and Outreach for North East) which was initially aimed to assess the feasibility of using drones to deliver vaccines and medical supplies in hard-to-reach areas of North East India (Manipur & Nagaland). This was carried out in various difficult geographical terrains including land, islands, foothills, and hills to explore different case scenarios. With the successful execution of the study, this initiative has now expanded the horizons in different health case scenarios and parts of India such as Himachal Pradesh (medical essentials delivery at high altitude 10000ft+ and sub-zero degree temperatures), Telangana (delivering the TB sputum samples from primary health care centres to district TU units), Karnataka (delivering the intra-operative pathological samples from peripheral hospitals to tertiary care hospitals), Delhi NCR (exploring the feasibility of using drones for transportation of Blood bags and its products), etc.
